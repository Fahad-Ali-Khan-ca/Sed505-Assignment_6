**Problem Statement:**
Traditional text classification often grapples with the curse of dimensionality, particularly when dealing with a large corpus of text. One-hot encoding, a common technique for converting text to numerical data, results in sparse and unwieldy matrices, posing computational challenges and potentially degrading model performance.

**How the Hash Feature Pattern Solves the Problem:**
The Hash Feature pattern mitigates these challenges by employing a hash function to map high-dimensional word features to a lower-dimensional vector space, known as feature hashing. This not only conserves memory but also enables constant-time feature extraction, crucial for efficiency. Careful selection of the hash function's bucket size balances the trade-off between dimensionality and the risk of collisions, which could impact the accuracy of the model.


For the Complex Code example, we'll have three files:

  1. **HashFunction.h**: Defines the hash function.
  2. **InputData.h**: Handles the input data.
  3. **SentimentAnalysisModel.h**: Contains the mock model.
  4. **main.cpp**: The main driver code that uses the above components.

**How it works ?**
- `HashFunction.h`: This file defines a hash function class, crucial for converting textual data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. It's initialized with a bucket size that determines the feature space, balancing the hashing efficiency and the risk of collisions.

- `InputData.h`: In this file, the InputData class is responsible for managing the raw text input, which involves preprocessing tasks such as tokenizationâ€”breaking down text into individual words or tokens.

- `SentimentAnalysisModel.h`: This file contains the SentimentAnalysisModel class, which simulates a machine learning model. The train method in this class is a placeholder for the actual training logic, demonstrating how the hashed features would be utilized in practice.

- `main.cpp`: The main driver code orchestrates the process: it takes user reviews, processes them through the InputData class, hashes the preprocessed data using HashFunction, and finally passes these features to the train method of the SentimentAnalysisModel class.

While the example provided simplifies certain steps for demonstration purposes, it illustrates the practical application of the Hash Feature pattern in a real-world text classification scenario. The bucket size for the hash function is a critical parameter that should be optimized based on the specific dataset and the machine learning model's requirements.
